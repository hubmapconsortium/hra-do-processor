    title: Tissue Block
    description: >-
      A tissue block is a defined piece of tissue extracted from a
      specific location for research or analysis, with detailed
      information about its extraction site, tissue sections,
      associated datasets, section counts and sizes, and collision
      summaries related to spatial overlaps.
